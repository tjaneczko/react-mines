# react-mines

A small project to learn React + ES2015 by recreating Minesweeper.  Right now, the project is very messy, and was
thrown together over the course of a couple hours.  I will be cleaning it up and continuing to explore React and
ES2015.

## Installing, Building and Running

To build, simply run the following:

```
npm install
gulp build
```

Once the project is built, launch `/index.html` in your favorite browser.
